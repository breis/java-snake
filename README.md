# java-snake
Java game for teaching purposes from Summer 2014

This code is a royal mess, but it's my royal mess.

The first large (more than two class files) Java application I ever wrote, I threw this snake game together over the course of a week or so as a supplement for my Java summer camp classes. The last day of class, we would open up the code and add in the lines to make the snake "move" under the ChangeDirection class.

The kids had great fun with the code and were able to find where to change the colors, the speed of the snake, whether or not the snake could die, how big the game was, how big the tiles were, etc. I had a few superstars even put in a way to restart the game without closing it and re-opening it. All of this in spite of it being a disorganized mess, so I like to think they walked away having learned something.

I had grand designs of creating more games with this tile-based "framework", like Minesweeper or a basic RPG. Maybe someday I'll try again. ...From scratch.

Some of the classes (GraphicsBackground, SimpleGraphics, and MyClass) were used for a different lesson and are unrelated to the game.
